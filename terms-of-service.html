                These Terms and any dispute or claim arising out of or in
                connection with them (including non-contractual disputes or

              <h4>11.1 Force Majeure</h4>
              <p>
                We shall not be liable for any failure or delay in performance
                of our obligations under these Terms arising out of or caused by
                events beyond our reasonable control, including (but not limited
                to) natural disasters, war, terrorism, riots, embargoes, acts of
                civil or military authorities, fire, floods, accidents, network

              <h4>11.2 Severability</h4>
              <p>
                If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or
                unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum
                extent permissible, and the remaining provisions will remain in
                full force and effect.

                No failure or delay by us in exercising any right, power, or
                privilege under these Terms shall operate as a waiver thereof,
                nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right preclude
                any other or further exercise of that right or the exercise of
                any other right.
              </p>
